# MAZE-FIGHTER-V2
This is my fps game project I made unity in high school
Maze Fighter is an FPS game where the player's home world is in peril because an evil spirit has destroyed the Gem of Life, the world's life source, so the Gem of Life has been scattered to four pieces. Fortunately the player has built a portal machine that will take them to the evil spirit's whereabouts, but needs the four pieces to power it. The player must complete levels to retrieve the four pieces, power up the portal machine, and defeat the evil spirit to save the world!
